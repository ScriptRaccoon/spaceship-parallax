# Space Parallax

https://spaceship-parallax.netlify.app

This is a space shooter game. You can navigate a spaceship through space, which is able to shoot asteroids. The stars in the background show a parallax effect, therefore the name.

This is a demonstration how to use multiple HTML canvases and animated sprites with JavaScript (see also [this repository](https://github.com/ScriptRaccoon/Sprite-Animation)).

The branches `tutorial-part-1` etc. represent the progress for the 4-part tutorial on my YouTube channel. The branch `migration-to-typescript` is not merged and has an (almost-finished) migration of the codebase from JS to TS.
