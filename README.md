This is a demonstration how to use multiple HTML canvases and animated sprites (see also [this repository](https://github.com/ScriptRaccoon/Sprite-Animation)).

The image of the idle spaceship comes from https://opengameart.org/content/spaceship-fighter-ipod1. The images of the asteroid come from https://opengameart.org/content/asteroid-l.
